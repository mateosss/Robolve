# TODO: Finish this, should explain the rules of every file and how to use them

# Sketch Folder

This folder contains automated blend files and other assets that helps with the generation of sprites

## Blend Files

General Rules:

    - Distance of multiples of 8
    - Put an asterisk in a object name if it is a meta object, like a lamp or an empty, that way it appears first in the outliner, 
    - Also if it has an asterisk in the name, then you should not delete it because it is important

### Robots.blend

### Animations.blend

**Be careful:**
 - There should be only one scene called Scene
 - Don't delete the armature

**What you can do in this file**:
 - Modify the render settings
 - Improve the rigging of the Armature
 - Create new animations
 - Run the animate.py script for export everything

### Deffense.blend
